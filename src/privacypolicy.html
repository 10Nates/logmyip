    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how LogMyIP.com ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our website. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and protection of your personal data while providing our services.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use our service, we collect the following information:</p>
    <p>1. IP Address: Upon your request, we collect your IP address to determine your approximate location.</p>
    <p>2. Approximate Location Data: We derive your approximate geographic location based on your IP address. This location data is further rounded to enhance your privacy.</p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely to:</p>
    <p>- Display your approximated location on our public map</p>
    <p>- Fulfill your specific request to participate in our location-sharing service</p>
    <p>- Maintain the technical functionality of our service</p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>We store:</p>
    <p>- Your IP address</p>
    <p>- Your rounded location coordinates</p>
    <p>This information is retained until you request its removal. We do not use this data for any purpose beyond displaying it on our map as requested by you.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Hosting</h2>
    <p>Our website and all associated data are hosted on a Virtual Private Server (VPS). This means your data is stored on remote servers managed by our VPS provider. While we maintain control over these servers, the physical infrastructure is maintained by the VPS provider. We have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure the security of your data within this hosting environment.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We utilize a third-party API service to convert your IP address into geographic coordinates. The sharing of your IP address with this service occurs only when you explicitly request to be added to our map. Please note that this third-party service may have its own privacy practices which are beyond our control.</p>
    
    <h2>Server Logs</h2>
    <p>In addition to the data specifically collected for our mapping service, our website maintains standard server logs which may include:</p>
    <p>- IP addresses</p>
    <p>- Browser type and version</p>
    <p>- Time and date of access</p>
    <p>- Pages visited</p>
    <p>- Referring websites</p>
    <p>These logs are used for technical maintenance, security purposes, and service optimization. They are deleted automatically without user request.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <p>- Request immediate removal of your data from our public map</p>
    <p>- Request complete deletion of your stored information from our systems</p>
    <p>Upon receiving your removal request, we will:</p>
    <p>- Immediately remove your location from the public map</p>

    <p>- Ensure complete removal from all of our backups within 30 days</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
